# TODO

## Main Tasks

- [ ] Refactor the app, having one part for designing and the other part for the installer application.
- [ ] This new installer application will allow the player to manage their installed stickers for each car (maybe also add balls stickers later on), add new stickers or remove them. The app will fetch those stickers from a server (maybe dropbox or google drive as I don't own a server). The app will be able to display the 3D model of the car and the stickers on it, allowing the player to see how it looks before installing it.
