### User Interface Overview

The user interface of Rocket League Designer is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Here are the main components:

Your decals are displayed as follow :

You can see the preview of the decal, the name and all the cars this decal is compatible with. For now the preview of the decal is simply the "body diffuse" of the decal, but in the future we will add a more advanced preview system.

By simply clicking on a car variant, you can manage the decal for this car. For now previewing (coming soon) and deleting the decal.

As rocket league decals are not applicable to all cars with a single decal file, this is why we have to manage decals per car variant.

#### Explore

This section allows you to explore and discover new decals created by the community.

Here the decals are displayed in the same way as in the My Collection section, but with a little twist for the car variants. You may see two colors representing the different car variants. The blue color meaning that you don't have the decal installed, and the gray color meaning that you already have the decal installed.

Here clicking on a decal you don't have installed will allow you to install it, and clicking on a decal you already have installed will allow you to update it (as we don't have a precise versioning system for decals, we allow users to update decals if they want to, even if no update have been made to the decal).
